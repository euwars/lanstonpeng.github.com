        "text":"Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called bardolatry.\nIn the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.\n(from wiki)",

   "text":"William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English painter, poet and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. His prophetic poetry has been said to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".\nHis visual artistry led one contemporary art critic to proclaim him \"far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced\".In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[3] Although he lived in London his entire life (except for three years spent in Felpham),he produced a diverse and symbolically rich oeuvre, which embraced the imagination as \"the body of God\" or \"human existence itself\"\n(from wiki)",
