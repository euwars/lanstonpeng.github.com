This very day,originally there&#39;re about  6 gays went to this small talk,Unfortunately,Only 3 left for some bussiness</p>

<p>So,we started to go(PS:we wait 801 for a while and we got there in around 40 mins when Defims had a hard time......)</p>

<p>The garden hotel is great inside and we didn&#39;t know why we get to the  U.S. Consulate General in Guangzhou Cultural Office .The room was filled with people so got to stand straightly</p>

<p>Honestly,I felt the talk was great although Defims and my roomate thought it&#39;s boring maybe.</p>

<p>In the very beginning , the speaker(I don&#39;t know the exact name) introduce something about US college education especially something in the surface</p>

<p>And I treated it as a knowledge improving and a listening practise</p>

<p>But,something she talked about the difference between the education in China and US really get engadget with me although I don&#39;t agree with some points of them at lease I&#39;m not act in that way she think</p>

<p>US students always ask questions and they learn while  practising  ,they focus on invention and their teachers&#39; inner sides are quite different from ours ,frankly speaking</p>

<p>Maybe I can do something like them ,Maybe I shall focus on more inquiry instead of receiving passively</p>
