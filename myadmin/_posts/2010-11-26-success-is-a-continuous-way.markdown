Well,I do acknowledge that suceess is straightway ,Howeverï¼ŒI was wrong

The time when I get a video from TED,I change my attitude to the "shape" of the way of success

It's a like a whell and when you achieve a temp goal U got to protect it and U have to push yourself instead of having a damn "rest"

You deserve to win or not only depend on yourself especialy on your will
