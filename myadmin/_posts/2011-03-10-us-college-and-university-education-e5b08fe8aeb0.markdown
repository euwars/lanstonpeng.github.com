This very day,originally there're about  6 gays went to this small talk,Unfortunately,Only 3 left for some bussiness

So,we started to go(PS:we wait 801 for a while and we got there in around 40 mins when Defims had a hard time......)

The garden hotel is great inside and we didn't know why we get to the  U.S. Consulate General in Guangzhou Cultural Office .The room was filled with people so got to stand straightly

Honestly,I felt the talk was great although Defims and my roomate thought it's boring maybe.

In the very beginning , the speaker(I don't know the exact name) introduce something about US college education especially something in the surface

And I treated it as a knowledge improving and a listening practise

But,something she talked about the difference between the education in China and US really get engadget with me although I don't agree with some points of them at lease I'm not act in that way she think

US students always ask questions and they learn while  practising  ,they focus on invention and their teachers' inner sides are quite different from ours ,frankly speaking

Maybe I can do something like them ,Maybe I shall focus on more inquiry instead of receiving passively
