Well,I've just seen a video from ted.com ,although it only last about 2 minutes ,I think it's pretty infomative.

There's no street names in Japan while there's only streets in America.

Most of others' opinions may affect what you think while you first truely think it'll work.In addition, the envionrment can influence you so much ,

somethimes ,I just say sometimes ,you got to protect your thought and dreams cause it may work in another side .
