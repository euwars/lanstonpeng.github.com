都是一些很受用的东西,的确是这样的
Your time is limited ,so
don't waste it living someone else's life

Don't be trapped by dogma which is living
with the results of other
people's thingking

Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice

And most important
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what your truly want to become
